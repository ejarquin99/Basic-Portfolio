                Hi there! Welcome to my portfolio page, my name is Edwin Jarquin.
                <br>
                I am a Miami Native & aspiring developer with 6+ years of experience in the Hospitality Industry.
                <br>
                 I am currently working at Cooper's Hawk Winery & Restaurant in Doral as a Tasting Room Attendant, so that makes me very knowledgeable about wine, food, and food pairings.
                <br>
                 I also have a background and appreciation for distilled spirits and beer as I was a bartender for 2 of those 6+ years. 
                 <br>
                 I enjoy outdoor physical activities like hiking, running, cycling, and swimming. 
                 I also enjoy reading the news, educating myself on various topics and always keeping myself up to date with any important trends happening around the world; including the technology industry.

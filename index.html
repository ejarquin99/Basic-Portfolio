                Hi there! Welcome to my portfolio page, my name is Edwin Jarquin.
                <br>
                I am a Miami Native with 6+ years of experience in the Hospitality Industry.
<br>
                 I am currently working at Cooper's Hawk Winery & Restaurant in Doral as a Tasting Room Attendant, so that makes me very knowledgeable about wine, food, and how to pair the wine.
<br>
                 I enjoy learning new things and doing research on various topics that interest me.
                </p>
